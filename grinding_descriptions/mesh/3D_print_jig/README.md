2. Insert the Inner_cage into the Outer_cage.
3. Secure the Bearing by screwing the Bearing_cover onto the Outer_cage.
4. Fit only the silicone part at the tip of the Spatula into the Spatula_jig, and insert it into the Bearing to complete.


## Operational Notes
- If the surface of the Spatula has poor slip, it may hinder the collection of powder. Please use a Unipack (40mm width of S-4), or wrap it with medicine wrapping paper and fix it with tape.
- The Pestle and Spatula_jig may not fit well if there are gaps. Please use vinyl tape or seal tape to fill the gaps (vinyl tape is recommended for the Pestle as higher friction is preferable).
